## Last Week's Challenge

## Error Handling
TRY, EXCEPT
```py
try:
    x = 1
    print("it works!")
except:
    print("it broke.....")
```

## Challenge
Using a WHILE loop, continue to ask for attendees to attend the party.
If they're already on the list, don't add them.
If their name can be cast as a number, tell them they have a dumb name.
If the user types in a safe word, the WHILE loop exits.
Sort the list.
Finally, use a FOR loop to print the attendees on the list one at a time.
