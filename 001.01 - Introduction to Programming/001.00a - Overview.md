> "A computer program in its human-readable form is called source code. Source code needs another computer program to execute because computers can only execute their native machine instructions."

## Why Python?

Python has a simple, english-based syntax, making it perfect for beginners.
It is very widely used, so it's a worthwhile investment of your time to learn.
It can run on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

## Topics
I'm going to work through the Python tutorials at [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python)

This means a lot less prep work for me -- and also means that you will have familiar documentation after the workshop is over that you can go to, to recall syntax.
