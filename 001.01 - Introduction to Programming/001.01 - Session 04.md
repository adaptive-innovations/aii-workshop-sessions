## Last Week's Challenge

## Working with Lists
Create a list
```py
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] # Strings
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3] # Integers
list3 = [True, False, False] # Booleans
list4 = ["apple", 7, True] # Mixed Data Types
```

## Challenge
THE CHANGE CALCULATOR
- The user enters a purchase amount
- Then the user enters the amount tendered
- Calculate how many $100's/$50's/$20's/$10's/$5's/$1's/Quarters/Dimes/Nickels/Pennies to hand back to the customer.  

> Suggested PSEUDOCODE


This is Pseudocode:
A rough draft / sketch of the program. IT IS NOT PYTHON.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode
```py
# Get the input
AmountOwed = User Input A
AmountTendered = User Input B
# Iterate through the currency types
AmountChange = AmountTendered - AmountOwed
AmountCalculated = AmountChange
WHILE AmountCalculated > 0:
    IF AmountCalculated > 100:
        BillOneHundreds += 1
        AmountCalculated - 100
    ELSE IF AmountCalculated > 50:
        BillFiftys += 1
        AmountCalculated - 50
    ETC...
    ETC...
    ELSE
        CoinsPennies += 1
        AmountCalculated - 0.01
# Build the response
LIST APPEND BillOneHundreds + " $100's"
LIST APPEND BillFiftys + "## $50's"
ETC
FOR EACH IN LIST:
    PRINT EACH
```
