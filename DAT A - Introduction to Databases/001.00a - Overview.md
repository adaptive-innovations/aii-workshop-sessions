# DAT A - Introduction to Databases

[SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp)

>The move from paper to computer databases was a huge leap in information management and storage. Databases are much more efficient than paper storage in that they take up less space, are easily accessed by multiple users at once and can be transferred long distances with virtually no delay. The use of databases allowed for the rise of corporate infrastructure, credit card processing, email and the Internet. Databases allow for data to be shared across the world instead of being housed in one location on a physical piece of paper.

- Cross-organizational
- Centralization
- Loosely-coupled architecture
