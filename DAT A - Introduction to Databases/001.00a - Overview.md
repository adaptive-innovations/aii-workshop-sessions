# DAT A - Introduction to Databases
>The move from paper to computer databases was a huge leap in information management and storage. Databases are much more efficient than paper storage in that they take up less space, are easily accessed by multiple users at once and can be transferred long distances with virtually no delay. The use of databases allowed for the rise of corporate infrastructure, credit card processing, email and the Internet. Databases allow for data to be shared across the world instead of being housed in one location on a physical piece of paper.

- **SQL** is a **Query Language** for accessing and manipulating databases.
- **SQL Server** is a **DBMS** (Database Management System).
Data is stored to and retrieved from a SQL Server instance. More specifically, SQL Server is a **RDBMS** (Reliational Database Management System). It usually runs on a dedicated server, but you can install it on almost any PC.
 
## What is a relational Database?

Relational databases are the most commonly used type of database.

SQL Server is only one of many variants.

Other relational database examples:
- SQL Server
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- PostGreSQL

## Info
- Several types of databases have been around since the early 1960s.
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL was created in the early 1970s.
- SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

## Uses
- Most **websites** use databases to store data.
- From the stock market to your local bank, databases are abundant across the **financial** world. Everywhere information needs to be saved and reused, a database is involved, whether itâ€™s your checking account or the price of gold at any given moment.
- **Sports** teams use data in performance analysis.
- **Governments** worldwide are constantly collecting our data for various reasons, such as research, defense, legislation, and humanitarian purposes.
