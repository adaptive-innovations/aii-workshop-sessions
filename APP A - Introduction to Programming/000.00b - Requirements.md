# Requirements

Please have these things on hand, installed, and ready prior to the first session. 
Everything you need is free.

## Hardware

- A computer running Windows 10.
> If you're using a work computer, make sure your IT folks have given you administrator-level permissions on it.

> I do not support Mac/Linux OS issues in class. If you feel confident enough to troubleshoot issues that arise during class while using an OS other than Windows, feel free to join but I strongly reccomend joining with a PC running Windows 10.
